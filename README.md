All UI Elements are made only in Storyboard. Works for all devices and Landscape mode

<h2>Custom Transitions</h2>


Custom Transitions do not use frames to move elements but only **CONSTRAINTS**. Solution for projects which use constraints, so it works in landscape mode without any problems, too.

For Navigation custom transitions, impelemnt in FirstVC <code>UINavigationControllerDelegate, UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate</code> protocols.
Custom Objects for Transitions are <code>PushAnimator, PopAnimator</code> and for modal transition <code>ModalAnimator</code.
